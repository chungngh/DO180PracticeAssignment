Dear Red Hatter, I think my game is almost up. We have to stop them from launching the ‘rocket’. I’ve found high explosives rigged to all its inner compartments. I don't think this rocket is a rocket at all. It's a missile and it's pointing straight at parliament house! Hopefully I can slip away. More instructions to follow.
