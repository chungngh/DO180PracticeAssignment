This fool Red Hatter thinks they are going to save Canberra when really they are going to DESTROY IT. Iâ€™ve given them the code, now we just wait. Soon Kosmos Galaxy Balsitic's reputation will be in tatters and their rocket will be destroyed. Best of all, Red Hat will be blamed. In one fell swoop, our two biggest competitors will be knocked out of the game forever. My bosses will be pleased.
