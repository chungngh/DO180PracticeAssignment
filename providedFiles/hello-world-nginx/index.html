   Dear Red Hatter, if you’re reading this it's too late for me, they’ve probably told you I ‘disappeared’. I haven't managed to complete my work so it's up to you to save Canberra.  Doesnt <b>K</b>osmos <b>G</b>alaxy <b>B</b>alistics sound familiar to you? Mark my words, they’re going to ask you to launch the ‘rocket’ so Red Hat will be blamed for all of this. We have one last hope. I managed to create an alternative launch code for the countDown app that will trigger the missile to self-destruct. Please Red Hatter, save us all. The code is 552479.
